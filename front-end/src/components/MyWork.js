                This is a fullstack website that I made for a growing trucking company located in Southern California.
                I used <strong>React</strong> as a framework to display the content of the site. Along with the
                content, users are able to read the site in Spanish using a translation feature that I created with the
                <strong> Redux</strong> library. The backend was created using <strong>Node.js</strong> and it allows users
                to send service requests to the client.

              This site was a fun project that I did for a proof of concept for a website that I found online.
              The idea was to create a responsive website and change its design in order to make it look less
              disorganized and more appealing. This was a great practice for learning <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.

                This was another fun project that I made when I was practicing my <strong>JavaScript</strong>. It's a memory game
                based off of the Marvel movies. One awesome feature that I implemented is every element is randomly placed.
                This makes it so that no two games are the same despite the difficulty selected.
